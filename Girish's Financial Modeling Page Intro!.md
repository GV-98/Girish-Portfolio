Hello! In this humble page of mine, you can find some of the projects I had a major hand in shaping and finishing during my time as a Masters of Science (MSc) in Finance candidate at Simon Fraser University's
Beedie School of Business. Feel free to explore and reach out to me as well!
While my python codes are directly accessible on the github page, please keep in mind to download the raw data for
Excel files.
